### Deaflator - Helping to Communicate

This is the Git Repository of Deaflator Mobile App, an Application to communicate with Deaf People. Powered with **Microsoft Azure***.

This Application is developed for Microsoft Azure Virtual Hackathon 2021 by **Feelcoomers - Eins** Team.


*still have problem with Integration so Microsoft Azure is not used, for now though...
